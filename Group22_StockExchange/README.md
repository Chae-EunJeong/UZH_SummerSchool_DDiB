# Subject
- Stock Exchange System
# Platform we chose and reasons
### Which platform?
- Ethereum
### Why?
- Ethereum => Bitcoin technology + Smart Contracts + DApp
- Smart Contract : self-executing contract digitally between parties without third-party
- DApp(Decentralized Application) : an application which runs on a blockchain
# Critical Evaluation
- It extends Bitcoin technology
  - using Proof of Work for mining
  - problem of energy consumption
- Smart contracts implemented by Solidity language
  - developer must to learn Solidity
  - human errors can be occurred
# What data is stored and how?
- Smart contract between buyer and seller
  - who buy/sell order
  - whose buy/sell signed
  - how much stock traded
  - shareholder lists
- Functions implemented on the smart contract is executed, then data about transactions should be stored in the blockchain
# Outlook
- Based on Ethereum blockchain, we designed stock exchange platform
- Everyone can trade stocks with having same information
- In the future
  - if DApp utilized increasingly,
  - people could become familiar with blockchain technology, 
  - such as immutable, security, distribution, sharing, transparency, etc.
